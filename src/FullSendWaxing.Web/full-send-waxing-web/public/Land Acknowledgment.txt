Land Acknowledgment

DaɁaw (Lake Tahoe) is the homeland of the waší∙šiw (Washoe people – the people from here). The waší∙šiw are the aboriginal stewards of the land in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin since the beginning of time and as a sovereign nation the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, as it is known today, continues to advocate for the protection and preservation of waší∙šiw ɁítdeɁ (the Washoe peoples homelands). The waší∙šiw relied on the land for survival; hunting, fishing, and gathering of traditional foods and medicines within their homelands was an integral part of the wá∙šiw (Washoe) culture and through this intrinsic relationship they helped shape the natural beauty of the Lake Tahoe Basin that so many enjoy today. As colonizers arrived in mass in the Comstock during the gold rush era, the wá∙šiw summer camps became prime locations for logging and cattle grazing and the waší∙šiw were no longer allowed to manage their lands as they had done for millenniums. The removal of wá∙šiw people from the land and increase in tourism to the Lake Tahoe Basin has negatively impacted an area that is not only renowned for its natural beauty and pristine waters but is now in dire need of rehabilitation.  The Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California has maintained their role as environmental stewards of the Lake Tahoe Basin (despite policies that sought to eradicate them) by continuing to advocate for their homelands and to protect, respect, and take care of waší∙šiw ɁítdeɁ. As we acknowledge the Lake Tahoe Basin as the homeland of the waší∙šiw, we ask that you, as visitors to our homelands/these lands, treat this place with the same respect as those who walked before you, the waší∙šiw.
